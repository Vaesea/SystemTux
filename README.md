# SystemTux

This is meant to be a tux platformer based on the sega master system and mario games, not to be confused with SuperTux.

The contributors thingy is wrong because this was forked from https://github.com/wojciech-bilicki/MarioBrosTutorial so it lists the creator of that repository as a contributor.
